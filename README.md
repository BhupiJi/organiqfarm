# Alex Rivera — Static Portfolio (Tailwind starter)

## Files
- index.html
- pages/about.html
- pages/projects.html
- pages/contact.html
- styles/*.css
- scripts/main.js

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repository and push the project root to it (all files/folders).
2. In the repository settings → Pages:
   - Source: `main` branch
   - Folder: `/ (root)` (or `/docs` if you placed site files there)
3. Save — GitHub will publish at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
4. If pages are at root, `index.html` will be served automatically.

## Notes
- The site uses the Tailwind CDN for styling. For production you may want to integrate a build step to purge unused CSS for smaller filesize.
- Contact form is static — connect a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, Getform) for form submissions.
- Replace Unsplash image URLs with your own images in `assets/images/` if preferred.

## Accessibility & SEO
- Semantic tags and ARIA attributes were used for nav and modal.
- Keep descriptive alt text when you replace placeholder images.

Enjoy! 🚀
